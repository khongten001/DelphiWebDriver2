# DelphiWebDriver

A modern, lightweight Delphi client (No third party) for the W3C WebDriver protocol (the same protocol used by Selenium). This library allows Delphi developers to automate browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge by communicating with their corresponding WebDriver executables.

---

## ✨ Features

* Create and manage WebDriver sessions
* Navigate to URLs
* Locate elements (`By.Id`, `By.Name`, `By.ClassName`, `By.CSS`, `By.XPath`)
* Click elements, send keys, submit forms
* Take screenshots and save to file
* Wait for elements to appear or conditions to be true
* Manage cookies, frames
* Interface-based memory management for stability
* Cross-browser support (Chrome only for now)
* And more cool stuff is coming...

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

* Delphi 10.2+ (or any recent version)
* Corresponding WebDriver binaries:

  * ChromeDriver (download from here https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads)

Place the driver executable in your PATH or next to your application.

### Example Usage

```delphi
uses
  DelphiWebDriver.Core,
  DelphiWebDriver.Types,
  DelphiWebDriver.Capabilities,
  DelphiWebDriver.Server,
  DelphiWebDriver.Interfaces;

procedure TMainForm.StartChromeButtonClick(Sender: TObject);
var
  Server: TWebDriverServer;
  Driver: IWebDriver;
  Caps: TWebDriverCapabilities;
  TranslateBox: IWebElement;
begin
  Server := TWebDriverServer.Create('chromedriver.exe');
  try
    Server.Start; // launch ChromeDriver

    Driver := TWebDriver.Create('http://localhost:9515');
    try
      Caps := TWebDriverCapabilities.Create;
      try
        Caps.BrowserName := 'chrome';
        Driver.StartSession(Caps);
      finally
        Caps.Free;
      end;

      Driver.Navigate('https://translate.google.com/');

      // Wait for translate box and send text
      TranslateBox := Driver.WaitUntilElement(TBy.XPath('//*[@id="yDmH0d"]/c-wiz/div/div[2]/c-wiz/div[2]/c-wiz/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div/c-wiz/span/span/div/textarea'));
      TranslateBox.SendKeys('Hello from DelphiWebDriver!');

      // Take screenshot
      Driver.SaveScreenshotToFile('screenshot.png');

    finally
      Driver.Quit;
    end;
  finally
    Server.Stop;
    Server.Free;
  end;
end;
```

## ⚡ Notes

* Use **interface variables** (`IWebDriver`, `IWebElement`) for safe automatic memory management.
* Avoid keeping element references after quitting the driver.
* `WaitUntilElement` supports **Id, Name, ClassName, CSS Selector, XPath**.
* `TWebDriverServer` helps start/stop ChromeDriver for your tests.
